<p><strong>Activists and Artists</strong></p>

<p>Let us begin by proposing that “the Left”, since its inception, has been divided into two main camps: a) the “bread and butter” up-the-workers Left of the trade union movement and various activist organisations, and b) the progressive counterculture or <em>avant-garde</em> located around the spheres of art, music, film, poetry and so on<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. While both of these aggregates are united in adhering to some kind of anti-capitalist critique, each approach and enact their critique of capitalism in strikingly different ways and languages, varyingly leading to either 1) productive mutually reinforcing collaboration or 2) bitter hatred and resentment between the two camps. For shorthand, let us conceive of this as a split between the <em>activists</em> and the <em>artists</em>. (With all the usual caveats that such a shorthand is necessarily reductive - of course activists can also be artists, and artists can be activists, and many people actually are both those things.)</p>

<p>What is the nature of this split?</p>

<p>To start with the artists, we can first note that they primarily enact their critique <em>aesthetically</em>: their aim is oriented around the production of a singular Work or Event that ruptures common sense and forces us to drastically rethink our place in the universe, sometimes to such an extent that it initially offends all our pre-existing tastes and sensibilities. As indicated, this approach is driven by a logic of <em>singularity,</em> seeking to strike that uncanny moment that is simultaneously both absolutely unique and yet absolutely universal, a kind of return of the repressed that both horrifies and captivates us.</p>

<p>Consequently, while the artist is (usually) highly sympathetic to the critique of capitalism, they try and integrate such a critique into a broader, more universal frame. This often makes such a critique more muffled or abstract than, say, the activist would like: a film director may decide to critique capitalism’s ecological destruction by directing and writing a film that is heavily laden with ecological themes, without mentioning the words “capitalism” or “working class”, for example, at all in it. Nonetheless, in that the film presents us with a particular vision of Nature that capitalism works to obstruct, the artwork can be said to function as a critique of capitalism.</p>

<p>This is because the artist seeks to conjure and use a language that is <em>poetic</em> rather than direct and literal. The intention is not really to use language as a <em>tool</em> whose only function is to “point to” things in the exterior “real” world, but to treat language as a <em>medium</em> to be explored, stretched, cut up, etc, as a raw material with its own Truth. To borrow a point from Badiou, the artist seeks a Truth that is not propositional (i.e. does not take the form of a proposition which we then “prove”) but poetic. Or to put it in a Deleuzian register, artistic language follows a logic of <em>expression</em> rather than representation<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. The artistic “language” of (a) painting, for instance, is not one that ultimately seeks to refer to an exterior ground – though it may, by happenstance, do that – but rather <em>seeks to be a ground itself</em>, to be a new Truth of its own.</p>

<p>In contrast to this aesthetic approach, the <em>activists</em> approach their critique <em>politically</em>, attempting to organise the working class into some kind of collective organisation (party, union, guerrilla, etc.) held together by a common vision. Unlike artistic production, this organising is driven not by a logic of singularity but <em>commonality</em>: the activist does not seek to “stand out” among fellow members of the working class, like a singular artwork, but rather endeavours to be a <em>mediator</em> between such workers<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>, helping them to see past their particular differences and become conscious of their shared subjugation. The activist is a far more deferential figure than the artist as a result: they become skilled in the arts of conversation and persuasion, learning to tease the worker out of themselves and into dialogue with their fellow workers. The activist is always keenly aware of this: it is not their voice that ultimately matters, but the subjugated members of the working class that they organise with.</p>

<p>Alongside this organising activity, a political programme emerges, which seeks to give concrete expression to this commonality, acting as a faithful cross-section of its members’ situations and interests. What quickly becomes clear when drafting this document, answering the questions “Who are we and what do we want?”, is that what the workers hold in common is not so much a set of positive qualities or attributes, but <em>lacks</em>: lack of control over their work from their boss, lack of ownership over their home, lack of money, lack of respect from the police, and so on. Dark, spectral and vaporous, it is these lacks that form the truly generic set that, initially, forms the basis for the activist political organisation.</p>

<p>Translated at the level of the programme, such lacks dialectically become the basis for <em>demands</em>: open <em>antagonisms</em> rather than simple negations. The activists name their enemy and hold them responsible for their oppression and exploitation: the boss, the landlord, the police, the media. Through such a translation, it becomes evident that the logic of commonality that structures the political organisation necessarily leads to it being openly <em>particular</em> in its membership and approach<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>. Deferential to its members and openly antagonistic, the organisation never claims to speak, or be for, everyone, and nor could it function this way. Consequently, unlike the artwork, the political organisation is particular and pragmatic, grounded in specific concrete situations that they seek to intervene in. And it cannot be otherwise: for, as the “frame” of a situation is widened outwards and outwards, both in space and in time so as to become less and less particular, it becomes increasingly difficult to make and sustain political judgements. After all, from the point of view of deep cosmic time, does it really matter all that much if you organise your fellow workers at the job you hate and want to quit? Is going to another miserable protest worth your time? The activist can never really answer these questions, which anyway do not concern them: they care about the <em>here</em> and <em>now</em>, the blood boiling in their veins. Seeking to <em>distance</em> oneself from the immediacies of the present is scorned, either as lazy or aloof – a bourgeois privilege.</p>

<p>The artists, however, famously thrive on such distanced territory. Artistic genres and aesthetics such as the Gothic, sci-fi, and cyberpunk (to give just a few limited examples) have much to say about such cosmological, theological, ecological, technological, and philosophical concerns: the relation of man and machine, evolution, science, consciousness, aliens, God, the natural vs. the artificial… The activists? Not so much. Such distanced, abstract topics appear to have little immediate use in building the organisation.</p>

<p>Now, it is worth stressing that neither of these modes are better or worse: they are simply different ways of responding to a shared situation, and both can (and indeed often do) work together very productively. Today, most musicians, artists, and writers are broadly left-wing and have great sympathy and admiration for the work of organisers, particularly in unions like UVW and IWGB (the former of which now has a branch for creative and design workers). Furthermore, some of the most visible union struggles in the UK and US recently have also been in the creative sector, such as workers at the Tate, National Theatre and Southbank Centre <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/29/coronavirus-arts-workers-on-south-bank-in-london-rally-against-covid-job-cuts">striking over job losses two months ago</a>, or staff at both <a href="https://p4kunion.tumblr.com/">Pitchfork</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/viceukunion">Vice</a> forming unions which have won recognition and new contracts, as well as doing <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/pitchfork-staffers-stage-work-stoppage-in-protest-of-conde-nasts-union-busting">work stoppages</a>.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, however, such growing class consciousness among artists and creative workers does not seem to have been met with a growing “artistic” consciousness among activists on the Left. Indeed, for much of the contemporary “bread and butter” Left, the <em>avant-garde</em> is still something to be treated with suspicion: a pretentious, bourgeois plaything that is unnecessarily esoteric and detached from the everyday person’s life and concerns. And this is where the carrots come in.</p>

      <p>Something I spoke about in the <a href="https://www.underscoreblog.com/archive/2020/09/03/corbyn-glamour-dandy.html">“Corbyn, Glamour and the Working-Class Dandy”</a> post. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>The term “expression” may sound like vague nothing-speak, but Deleuze very rigorously theorises it, and its differences from signification/representation, in <em>Expression in Philosophy: Spinoza</em>. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>Clearly such organisations are not just made as workers – replace “workers” with “tenants”, “people of colour”, “queer people”, “women”, where appropriate, etc. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:4" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>The terminology is used precisely here: <em>singular</em> is not the same as <em>particular</em>. Whereas “singular” directs our attention to a certain absolute uniqueness, “particular” points us to the Whole that this particular thing is <em>part</em> of. When we talk about a “particular apple”, for instance, we are identifying this round, green object through the Whole (Apple-ness) that it is a part of. <a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
