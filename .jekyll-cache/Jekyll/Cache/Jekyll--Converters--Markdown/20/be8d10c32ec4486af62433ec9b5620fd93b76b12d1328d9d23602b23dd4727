<p><a href="https://twitter.com/xenogothic/status/1255661263339892741">Xenogothic was right</a>: this <a href="https://www.factmag.com/2014/04/29/deeper-underground-fact-meets-terre-thaemlitz-part-one/">interview</a> with Terre Thaemlitz is absolutely <em>essential</em> reading, and a true demonstration that true psychedelia, and perhaps even true punk, is served ice cold.</p>

<p>Thaemlitz is a useful figure because, as a musician and DJ (though they, understandably, prefer the term ‚Äúmedia producer‚Äù) rather than some dreary academic, they represent how coldness indexes not a lack of joy but a <em>higher state</em> of it. The typical image of ‚Äúbeing cold‚Äù evokes a miserabilism that refuses to accept change or do anything different, which is quite literally <em>frozen</em> into particular habits. But this only holds if one sees coldness as an absence of heat, rather than thinking coldness <em>in itself</em>. The question that Thaemlitz, producer of chilly deep house classic <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0rdBa0lmDeuUAaZF6PXxXf"><em>120 Midtown Blues</em></a>, thus prompts us to ask, then, is: where does coldness lead us, if not nothingness?</p>
