title: The Useless Carrot


----

I didn't think it would be 29 tonnes of carrots at my old university that would drag me out of my blogging slumber, but here we are.

Two days ago, a big pile of carrots were dumped outside the CCA Gallery at Goldsmiths.
It was revealed to have been an exhibition piece called "Grounding" by ___

[outline 2 camps very briefly]

I'm pleased to say that the responses to it have been far more thoughtful than I anticipated, but - expectedly - there's still been your usual dose of nauseating outrage, unthinking eye rolls and snarky, unproductive social media posts about it. Despite this, I understand these responses and do think they offer something of a valuable or productive critique ----.

Nonetheless, I think they also demonstrate quite a stark divide in the Left, that has essentially existed since the beginning of modernity: the split between a) the "bread and butter" up-the-workers Left of the trade union movement and b) the progressive counterculture or *avant-garde* located around the spheres of art, music, film, poetry and so on[^1]. (For shorthand, think of this as a split between the *activists* and the *artists*[^2].) While both of these strands define themselves against the dominant political culture as well as aligning themselves with some kind of anti-capitalism, they approach such a critique of capitalism in strikingly different ways and languages: the artist expresses their distaste *aesthetically*, oriented around the production of a singular Work or Event that ruptures__, while the activist does so *politically*, attempting to organise the working class into some kind of collective organisation (party, union, etc.) united by some common vision. Neither of these modes are better or worse: they are simply different ways of responding to a shared situation, and both can (and indeed often do) work together very productively.

As mentioned, though, these modes of critique function in incredibly different ways. The work of producing a great artwork is very different to the work of building a union, and each follow almost opposing logics. Artistic labour is defined by its singularity (which is not the same as individuality): it seeks to strike that uncanny moment that is simultaneously both absolutely unique and yet absolutely universal, a kind of return of the repressed that both horrifies and captivates us. Political organising, by contrast, strives for commonality rather than singularity:
These differences can make it all too easy for the two camps to come to distrust one another, for they each see enough of themselves in the other side to be invested in them, but simultaneously, they do not see enough of themselves in the other side for them to agree with them or support them. This is not destined to happen, however: very often both strands do find themselves converging in very productive and exciting ways.
[Most musicians, artists, writers etc are left-wing and I think have great sympathy and admiration for the work of organisers particularly in unions like UVW and IWGB. Some of the most visible union struggles here in the past few years have also been in the creative sector e.g. Tate or Pitchfork/Vice Union. Such class consciousness on the artist side, does not seem to have been matched by a growing artistic sensibility on the activist side of things.]

Mark Fisher's nascent concept of acid communism was explicitly designed to act as a kind of bridging between these two strands of the Left, and Fisher himself is one of the rare writers who is equally popular and respected in both

Without further ado, let us outline the dominant critique of The Carrots from the "activist" side of the equation, in order to expose its limitations, and consequently open it up to the "artist" side.

The dominant criticism of the piece seems to be that it is "tone deaf" when considering the existence of food poverty not just in local Lewisham, but around the world. By parading such a vast quantity of food in such a blatantly *useless* way, the piece is seen to be tantamount to a cruel mockery of the poor and homeless, quite literally dangling the carrot of food and satiation in front of them.

Additionally, a related criticism seems to concern to the function of art as a kind of "anything goes". The activists here critique the notion that the designation of something as "art" functions as its only necessary justification. The critique here is against the idea that art is only accountable to itself - in other words, against the idea of "art for art's sake"

As a result of these critiques, what has the activist response to The Carrots been? *To put them to use*. A group called \\@goldsmithscarrots on Instagram has been using the carrots to make and sell carrot cake, the proceeds of which are going to local food banks.
Of course, one imagines that these exasperated activists did such an activity somewhat begrudgingly: "we shouldn't have to do this! It should have just gone to the hungry in the first place!". This is the impression they give, at least: they are not joyfully engaging with The Carrots but very explicitly positioning themselves *against* the artwork, criticising it on their Instagram page and giving it the finger. It is all framed as a protest: by putting these carrots *to use*, they are protesting against the distasteful *wastefulness* of the artwork.

We see that it is these oppositions of *use vs. waste, usefulness vs. uselessness, necessary vs. surplus*, that the activist critique hinges around. Indeed, it is such a set of oppositions that seem to be at the heart of the artist vs. activist split in the Left more broadly: the activist hates the artist for their excess or luxury __, and the artist hates the activist for being a joyless, ascetic puritan

[^2]: With the obvious usual caveats that such a shorthand is necessarily reductive - of course activists can also be artists, and artists can be activists, and many people actually are both those things.
[^3]: For full disclosure, my sympathies lie more with the "artists" side of the equation here, having previously been someone who very firmly sat in the "activist" camp as a burned-out organiser during my time at university, and subsequently experienced the limitations and joylessness of such a position. But, like Fisher, I am not interested in pitting these two teams against each other, but enjoining in them in a mutually reinforcing positive feedback circuit. Hence this post.
