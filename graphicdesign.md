I occasionally do graphic design and video editing work upon request (and sometimes just to make memes), and can use Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign fluently. Contact me if you'd like me to do some work for you, and hopefully we can work something out!

**Fck Govt Fck Boris**

Was commissioned to make [this promotional video](https://www.facebook.com/KICKBORISOUT/videos/468063597345071/) for the "Fck Govt Fck Boris" street carnival / protest against Boris Johnson's undemocratic rise to prime minister. Got 70,000 views on Facebook and 52,000 on Twitter.

**RENT STRIKE**

I'm loosely part of the [RENT STRIKE](https://www.facebook.com/rentstriker/) collective, and have done lots of design and organising work for them over the past couple of years. They've got lots of cool things on their website, [which you can check out here](https://www.rent-strike.org/), ft. lots of useful resources for housing organising, especially if you're a student.

*Rent Strike Weekender*

* I made [this video](https://www.facebook.com/284436695262908/videos/310081386559387/) to promote the 2019 [RENT STRIKE Weekender](https://www.facebook.com/events/2139834089385735), which I also helped organise.
* Here's [another abandoned promo video](https://twitter.com/anarchoschism/status/1174461078106968064) for the weekender I made
* I also did most of the graphics for the weekender, e.g. [schedules](https://www.facebook.com/events/2139834089385735/permalink/2296874583681684/)
* I designed a fun lil turn-based role playing game for the weekender called the ["Rent Strike Endgame"](https://www.rent-strike.org/rentstrikeendgame), which is based on Plan C's [Social Strike Game](https://www.weareplanc.org/blog/the-social-strike-game/). You can play with as little as ~6 people, but the game works best with multiple groups of 6-10 people.

*Covid-19*

In response to the wave of student rent strikes emerging due to the coronavirus crisis, I edited, formatted and designed [this handbook](https://www.rent-strike.org/covid19) on running a student rent strike under lockdown conditions. Featuring a tacit endorsement from the big man himself, Boots Riley (he retweeted it on Twitter lol).
